    <p>There is nothing better than this dish on a cold day 
        or when it is raining outside. You have to try it, 
        but imagine a broth that is lightly spiced and with 
        a distinctive taste of chorizo. It is delicious and 
        filling and the leftovers keep perfectly on the fridge 
        for a couple of days! Good option to prepare for 
        the week.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 cup butternut squash 1 inch cubes</li>
        <li>3 links chorizo, sliced</li>
        <li>2 cans white butter beans NOT drained! keep the liquid</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin more to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon oregano more to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt (we used a Borsari salt blend)</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>100 grams spaghetti about 2 servings. We used gluten free rice noodles</li>
        <li>1 handful chopped basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat pan or pot on medium heat. Add a little 
            oil, chorizo and butternut squash. Cook until 
            he chorizo has released some of the grease. 
            About 5 min.</li>
        <li>Add the onion and cook until translucent. 
            About 8 min.</li>
        <li>Add beans and their liquid. Do not drain!</li>
        <li>Add the cumin, oregano and the salt, chicken 
            broth and water. Stir and taste the broth. 
            Add water, salt or spices to taste.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil and add the spaghetti. 
            Reduce the heat and simmer for 20 min. 
            The spaghetti doesn't have to be al dente for 
            this recipe, but if you prefer it that way, 
            add the spaghetti a bit later.</li>
        <li>Serve with fresh basil.</li>
    </ol>
