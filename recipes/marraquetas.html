    <p>Marraquetas, Chilean Bread or Pan Franc√©s (
        French rolls) or Pan Batido (whipped bread) is 
        the most classic Chilean bread.</p>
    <p>Marraquetas are an everyday bread, not shared with 
        guests but always present on the family table for 
        breakfast, lunch, tea, and dinner.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 1/2 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 2/3 cup cold water</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoon instant yeast</li>

    <oL>
        <li>Combine flour, salt, brown sugar, and yeast 
             the mixer, bread machine, or mixer bowl. 
             Add water and mix until it forms a ball. Dump 
             onto a floured counter and knead vigorously 
             for 10 minutes. Place in a clean bowl, drizzle 
             with vegetable oil, cover the bowl, and let rise 
             for 30 minutes. Knead gently into a ball and rest 
             90 minutes or more in the bowl until doubled in size.</li>

        <li>Divide the dough into six equal portions and make 
            balls with them. Sprinkle lightly with vegetable 
            oil spray, put them in a large Ziploc bag, and let 
            and 30 minutes.</li>  
            
        <li>Prepare two baking sheets, cover with parchment 
            paper, spray with vegetable oil, and coat with 
            semolina or cornmeal.</li>

        <li>To shape the Marraquetas: Make a ball and stretch 
            gently by hand, trying to make an oblong shape. 
            Make a cross with a wooden or metal rod (the handle 
            of wooden spoon works, for example). Then again, 
            sprayed with vegetable oil spray and placed in 
            prepared sheet, put them in the plastic bag and let 
            them grow for 15 minutes. Refrigerate overnight.</li>

        <li>Preheat oven to 475F or 245C with a pizza stone inside. 
            Put an empty pie pan on the oven floor. Put 1 cup of hot 
            water into the pie pan. Put the Marraquetas in the oven 
            over the stone, leaving the parchment paper. Sprinkle the 
            loaves of bread and the oven walls with water slightly. 
            Repeat 2 minutes later. And then one minute later. 
            Reduce oven temperature to 450F or 230C.</li>

        <li>Bake for 10 minutes. Rotate the pan. Continue baking for 
            10 minutes or until well browned. Turn off the oven and 
            leave in for 5-10 minutes, until they look dark and seem 
            to not stand another minute in the oven.</li>

        <li>Remove and let stand on a rack for at least 30 minutes. Eat!</li>
